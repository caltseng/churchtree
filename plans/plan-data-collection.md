# Plan: Plan for US Presbyterian Data Collection

This document defines how we will create the detailed data-collection plan
for US Presbyterian denominations.

## Purpose
Create a concrete, repeatable plan for collecting notes and converting them to
JSON for Presbyterian denominations in the United States.

## Inputs
- `docs/spec/data-collection-prompt.md` (notes extraction)
- `docs/spec/data-collection-json-conversion.md` (JSON conversion)
- `data/notes/template.md`
- `docs/architecture/data-model.md`

## Steps to create the plan
1. Define the target list of Presbyterian denominations (initial scope).
2. Group denominations by lineage clusters (e.g., PCUSA/PCUS/UPCUSA/OPC/PCA).
3. Choose primary sources for each cluster and record them in a draft source list.
4. Draft per-denomination notes collection tasks using the notes template.
5. Define validation checks (citations, dates, edge relationships).
6. Draft the JSON conversion checklist and file update order.
7. Review with stakeholders and finalize the data-collection plan.

## Output
- A detailed plan document for executing data collection in phases.
